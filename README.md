# Digital-Online-Electronic-Voting-App
1.1 Background to the Problem
A public election system constitutes the backbone of a democracy where the people have
to elect their state’s leader. As we all know Election uses a manual election system, which
causes several kinds of problems. Due to this paper ballot-based election system, some
problems are faced by voters before or during elections and others are faced by the
administration before and after the voting.
Many e-voting solutions lack transparency for voters and even for election administrators. If
not carefully planned and designed, the introduction of e-voting can undermine confidence in
the whole electoral process. So, to avoid this circumstance, we are organizing to open arrange
apps in an internet system, which includes methods like registration of voters, vote casting,
vote counting, and pronouncing results etc would constitute a great arrangement to replace
current system. So electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of votes,
decrease the cost of paying staff to count votes physically and can provide progressed
availability for disabled voters. Moreover Results can be detailed and distributed quicker.
1.2 Solution to the Problem
We are going to introduce a web-based online electronic voting app which will be able to process
data with computer software and record voting data. In this app, voter can easily cast his vote.
Due to the requirement, Admin can manage all those things like manage voter, voter
authentication, add manager and staffs, add election etc. For the secrecy of the vote, Admin will
avoid any connection between the voter’s identity and the vote cast in this app. In this way, This
app can be more secure for all users. This online voting app can increase accessibility, for example
with internet voting as well for housebound voters and voters from abroad. In this way, This
online voting app can Reduce the spoilt of ballot papers, can warn voters about any invalid votes 
and voter can cast vote only for one times. To Compared to postal voting, Internet voting can
reduce the incidence of vote-selling and family voting by allowing multiple voting. So our main
goal is to create a high quality and user friendly online voting app where voters can easily cast his 
vote from wherever there is an Internet connection.
